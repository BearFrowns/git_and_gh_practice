When I was a kid, my grandparents decided the best way to celebrate their wedding anniversary was to take a family trip across the western United States. We made a stop in Zion and all the kids got together to play Ghosts in the Graveyard. Two of them hid in plain sight by one getting on the others shoulders and utilizing the lighting of a phonebooth to make themselves look like an adult making a call. We ended up calling the game early because someone noticed we were being stalked by mountain lions on the nearby ridge.
